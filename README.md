# Tic-Tac-Toe 
This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the board is full resulting in a draw.

## Features:
* Two-player gameplay with 'X' and 'O' symbols.
* User-friendly input for selecting moves (row and column).
* Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns.
* Tie detection when the board is full.
* Option to play again after a game ends.

## How to Play:
1. Run the Python script `(tic_tac_toe.py)`.
2. The program welcomes you and displays the initial board.
3. Player 1 (X) takes their turn by selecting a row and column number (0, 1, or 2).
4. The board is updated, and the game checks for a win or tie.
5. If no winner or tie, Player 2 (O) takes their turn.
6. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.
7. After a game ends, you'll be prompted to play again (Y/N).
